      <!-- Add a Form with the following Inputs (and Validators)
           1) Mail address (should not be empty and should be an email address)
           2) A Dropdown which allows the user to select from three different Subscriptions ("Basic", "Advanced", "Pro")
              Set "Advanced" as Default
           3) A Password field (should not be empty)
           4) A Submit Button

           Display a warning message if the Form is invalid AND was touched. Display a warning message below each input if it's invalid.

           Upon submitting the form, you should simply print the Value of the Form to the Console.
           Optionally, display it in your template.
